# Diet & Exercise Tracking

Daily nutrition and exercise tracking with a Markdown journal, Excel spreadsheets, a chat dashboard, and a live HTML dashboard. Includes weight tracking with progress visualization, body composition metrics, tiered adaptive calorie targets, carb-load day protocol, alcohol enforcement, and weekly accountability reports.

> **This recipe is optional.** When disabled, the assistant never mentions food, calories, exercise, or weight tracking. It does not include meal planning, recipe suggestions, diet advice, or nutrition coaching. The system records and displays -- it doesn't lecture.

## What You Get

- **Daily journal** -- `Projects/Diet/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with structured meal tables, activity logs, and running totals
- **Spreadsheets** -- `food-log.xlsx` (meals + weight tracking), `exercise-log.xlsx` (activities) at workspace root
- **Chat dashboard** -- Colored emoji bars with macro flags and adaptive calorie display after every food or exercise log
- **Live HTML dashboard** -- `Dashboard-Fancy.html` at vault root; static weight chart and pace bars rebuilt on weigh-in, dynamic macro bars updated on every log via `diet-today.js`
- **Weight tracking** -- Two progress bars toward user goals, trend analysis, body composition metrics (optional), phases for different training cycles
- **Coach's Notes Log** -- `Knowledge/Health/Coach-Notes-Log.md` tracks dashboard notes across days for consistency; prevents advice from contradicting itself or chasing noise
- **Weekly accountability** -- Sunday routine with automated analysis report (four sections: Great, Good, Bad, Ugly) saved to Knowledge/Health/Weekly-Diet-Analysis/
- **Adaptive calorie target** -- Tiered exercise adjustment (7% for normal sessions, 10% for high-volume days) prevents under-fueling without eating back the full burn
- **Carb-load day protocol** -- Two-day window target with calorie range, carb floor, fat ceiling, three-point cross-check, and dashboard mode banner
- **Alcohol enforcement** -- Alcohol always logged as a separate entry; next-day journal note required with calorie count and percentage of daily target

## Configuration

### 1. Create the Diet directory

```bash
mkdir -p Projects/Diet Knowledge/Health/Weekly-Diet-Analysis
```

### 2. Create your Overview file

Create `Projects/Diet/Overview.md` with your targets and goals. Use this template:

````markdown
# Diet Journal -- Overview

Daily food tracking. Individual daily logs in this directory, named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

---

## Goals

Your personal goals drive progress bars and phases. Examples:
- Lose weight for an event (wedding, reunion, vacation, photo shoot)
- Hit a target weight or body composition
- Train for a race or athletic event
- Build muscle / body recomposition
- Improve energy levels or manage a health condition
- General longevity and health

**My goal(s):**
- [your goal here]

---

## Current Metrics

- **Current weight:** [weight] lbs / [kg]
- **Current body fat %:** [if you have it; optional]
- **Current muscle mass:** [if you have it; optional]
- **Age/sex:** [for TDEE context]

## Target Metrics

- **Target weight:** [weight] lbs / [kg]
- **Target body fat %:** [optional]
- **Target muscle mass:** [optional]

## Calorie Targets

| Metric | Rest Day | Training Day | Long Event Day |
|--------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Base calories | [e.g., 1,900] | [e.g., 2,200] | [e.g., 2,500] |
| Protein | [e.g., 130g] | [e.g., 150g] | [e.g., 160g] |
| Carbs | [calculated] | [calculated] | [calculated] |
| Fat | [calculated] | [calculated] | [calculated] |

**How adaptive targets work:**
- **Base calories:** Your maintenance or deficit/surplus baseline (e.g. TDEE - 300 for a cut)
- **Exercise multiplier:** 7% by default (suggested for most people). Multiply exercise calories burned × 0.07 and add to base target.
  - Example: 800 kcal run × 0.07 = +56 cal → target becomes 1,900 + 56 = 1,956 cal
  - This prevents bonking without eating back the full burn
  - Edit the multiplier in Diet-Dashboard-Display.md to adjust

**Macros:**
- Protein: set first, then carbs and fat split the remaining calories
- Fat: ~30% of base calorie target / 9 cal per gram
- Carbs: remainder after protein and fat

## Day Types

Define what qualifies as each type for your schedule:
- **Rest day:** No structured training (walking, light activity is fine)
- **Training day:** Structured run, bike, swim, gym session, or sports
- **Long event day:** Runs/rides over [X] km, races, multi-hour activities

## Weight Phases

Define phases for different training cycles. The Weight sheet in food-log.xlsx includes a Phase column.

Example phases:
- **Phase 1: Aggressive cut** (target -1.5 lbs/week)
- **Phase 2: Moderate cut** (target -0.75 lbs/week)
- **Phase 3: Maintenance** (stable)
- **Phase 4: Build** (slight surplus)

*Format: Name | Start Date | Target Weight | Target Rate | Notes*

| Phase | Start | Target Weight | Target Rate | Notes |
|-------|-------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| [phase 1] | [date] | [weight] | [rate] | |
| [phase 2] | [date] | [weight] | [rate] | |

## Snack Library

*Add foods you eat regularly; sort by macro benefit or category.*

### High Protein (quick snacks)
- [your items]

### Quick Carbs (training fuel)
- [your items]

### Balanced Options
- [your items]

## Event Prep Modes

Optional: If you're training for an event, define special target overrides. These override normal targets temporarily (e.g., carb loading, diet break, refeed days).

| Mode | Trigger | Calorie Mod | Carb Mod | Duration | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|----------|----------|-------|
| [e.g., Carb Load] | 2 days before race | +300 | +50g | 2 days | race prep |

## Running Averages

*Updated as journals accumulate.*

| Period | Avg Calories | Avg Protein | Days Tracked | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Last week | -- | -- | 0 | |
| Last 2 weeks | -- | -- | 0 | |

### 3. Copy the guidelines files from the template

The template ships these files in `Knowledge/Jesse-Guidelines/`. Copy them to your vault:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Diet-Logging-Flow.md` | Per-log-event flow, `diet-today.js` spec, alcohol rules, carb-load protocol, tiered exercise adjustment |
| `Diet-Dashboard-Guidelines.md` | ASCII dashboard format, colored emoji bars, flags, adaptive targets, sync rules |
| `Weight-Tracker-Guidelines.md` | Weight tracking, 14-day dual regression, progress bars, phases, body composition |
| `Fancy-Dashboard-Build.md` | HTML dashboard architecture — single source of truth for `Dashboard-Fancy.html` |
| `Sunday-Weekly-Diet-Analysis.md` | Weekly accountability report format (Great / Good / Bad / Ugly) |

Also copy `Knowledge/Health/Coach-Notes-Log.md` from the template.

### 4. Add to your instruction file

Add to your instruction file's `## Rules` section:

```markdown
### Diet Tracking

Daily food journal at `[[Projects/Diet/Overview]]` (targets and goals defined there). Daily logs are `Projects/Diet/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Excel trackers at workspace root: `food-log.xlsx` (meals + weight) and `exercise-log.xlsx` (activities). When the user logs a meal or exercise, follow `[[Knowledge/Jesse-Guidelines/Diet-Logging-Flow]]`. When the user asks about their state without new data, show the ASCII dashboard per `[[Knowledge/Jesse-Guidelines/Diet-Dashboard-Guidelines]]`. Weight tracking uses the Weight sheet in food-log.xlsx per `[[Knowledge/Jesse-Guidelines/Weight-Tracker-Guidelines]]`. HTML dashboard lives at `Dashboard-Fancy.html` (vault root) — see `[[Knowledge/Jesse-Guidelines/Fancy-Dashboard-Build]]` for build rules. Every Sunday, produce a weekly accountability report per `[[Knowledge/Jesse-Guidelines/Sunday-Weekly-Diet-Analysis]]` and save to `Knowledge/Health/Weekly-Diet-Analysis/`.
```

### 5. Create spreadsheet templates

On first use, create both spreadsheets with these columns:

**food-log.xlsx:**
- Sheet 1 (Food Log): Date, Meal, Item, Amount, Unit, Grams, Calories, Protein, Fat, Carbs, Notes
- Sheet 2 (Weight): Date, Weight, Weight (kg), Phase, Body Fat %, Muscle Mass, Notes

**exercise-log.xlsx:** Date, Type, Description, Distance (km), Duration, Pace (min/km), Elevation (m), Avg HR, Cadence, Calories, Plan Source, Notes

Or create them manually with those headers if you prefer to have them ready.

## Daily Journal Format

Each day's journal follows this structure:

````markdown
# Food Journal -- [Day], [Date]

**Day type:** [Rest / Training / Long Event] ([activity context])
**Weight:** [if weighed in]
**Phase:** [current phase, if tracking]

## Breakfast

| Item | Amount | Grams | Calories | Protein | Fat | Carbs | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|----------|---------|-----|-------|-------|
| | | | | | | | |
| **BREAKFAST TOTAL** | | **g** | **cal** | **g** | **g** | **g** | |

## Lunch

[same table format]

## How It Works

### Two-Layer Dashboard Architecture

The system maintains two live views of today's data:

**Layer 1 — `Dashboard-Fancy.html`** (vault root): The persistent HTML dashboard. Rebuilt on morning weigh-in or on request. Contains the weight trend chart (Chart.js), metric cards, 14-day pace bars, progress bars toward goal weights, body composition bars (when available), and coach's notes. Opening the file in a browser gives a visual overview without interacting with the assistant.

**Layer 2 — `diet-today.js`** (vault root): A small JavaScript file that holds today's food and exercise data as `window.DIET_TODAY`. Rewritten on every food or exercise log. The static HTML loads this file, so the macro bars and food log sections in the dashboard update on the next browser reload -- no HTML rebuild needed.

### Logging Meals

1. User says: "log breakfast: two eggs, toast with butter, coffee with whole milk"
2. Assistant estimates macros from knowledge base; checks food-log.xlsx for recent entries of the same items to reuse values (prevents drift)
3. Updates the daily journal table, appends to food-log.xlsx, recalculates running totals
4. Rewrites `diet-today.js` with updated macro totals, meal items, and flags
5. Shows the ASCII dashboard in chat with colored emoji bars
6. Fancy dashboard auto-updates on next browser reload via `diet-today.js`

### Logging Exercise

1. User says: "logged a 7km run, 38 minutes, avg HR 155"
2. Assistant estimates calories burned, updates the daily journal Activity section, appends to exercise-log.xlsx
3. Rewrites `diet-today.js`; ASCII dashboard shows two-line calorie display:
   - Line 1: baseline intake vs. adaptive target
   - Line 2: net (intake − burn), gray bars, informational only
4. Adaptive target uses tiered exercise adjustment: ≤1,500 cal burned → 7%; >1,500 cal → 10%

### Logging Weight (Weigh-In)

1. User says: "weighed in: 175.5 lbs"
2. Assistant adds row to Weight sheet in food-log.xlsx
3. Rebuilds `Dashboard-Fancy.html`: weight chart updates, pace bars recalculate from the 14-day trailing window (trough + raw regression shown as a range), progress bars refresh, coach's notes regenerate
4. New notes appended to `Knowledge/Health/Coach-Notes-Log.md`

### Logging Alcohol

Alcohol is always logged as a separate **Alcohol** meal entry:
1. Calories logged under meal name "Alcohol"
2. The next day's journal includes a note: total alcohol calories and percentage of daily target

### Carb-Load Days

Two days before a long run (threshold configurable in `Overview.md`):
- Targets shift: calories 2,400–2,600 (window metric), carbs 400–500g, fat ≤ 50g ceiling
- Dashboard header shows `CARB-LOAD DAY 1/2` or `CARB-LOAD DAY 2/2`
- Calorie bar switches to window metric (green only in-range, not ceiling-only)
- Three-point cross-check at day-end: calories in range, carbs ≥ 400g, fat ≤ 50g

### Weekly Accountability (Sunday)

1. Every Sunday at start of day, assistant generates a report with four sections: Great, Good, Bad, Ugly
2. Ranked improvement suggestions based on actual data
3. Week-over-week trend table
4. Saved to Knowledge/Health/Weekly-Diet-Analysis/ with date prefix
5. Brief summary shown in morning briefing

### Correcting Entries

If the user corrects a value ("that was 350 not 300"):
- Update the daily journal table
- Update the corresponding row in food-log.xlsx
- Recalculate running totals
- Rewrite `diet-today.js` with corrected values
- Refresh ASCII dashboard in chat

## Tips and Gotchas

**Estimates are estimates.** Calorie and macro values come from the assistant's knowledge, not a food database API. They're close enough for tracking trends but not lab-precise. Correct values when you know better, and the system reuses those values for future entries of the same food.

**The ASCII dashboard is configurable.** The 20-character bar width, colored emojis, flag thresholds, and adaptive calorie formula are all defined in `Diet-Dashboard-Guidelines.md`. Edit that file to change them.

**Day types are yours to define.** The template suggests Rest/Training/Long Event but you can define whatever categories fit your schedule. The targets table in Overview.md adapts.

**Tiered adaptive targets prevent under-fueling high-volume training.** Normal sessions use 7% of exercise calories; sessions burning >1,500 cal use 10%. Both rates are conservative -- the system does not add back the full burn. Adjust the thresholds and rates in `Diet-Logging-Flow.md`.

**Weight tracking is optional.** If you don't have a scale, skip the Weight sheet and the HTML dashboard. The system works fine with just food and exercise data.

**Spreadsheets are the long-term record.** Daily journals are good for day-of review. Spreadsheets are what feeds weekly/monthly trend analysis and the Sunday accountability reports.

**Food identification prevents drift.** The system reuses nutritional values from your recent `food-log.xlsx` entries for the same item, preventing the slow creep of inconsistent estimates over time.

**Event-prep modes override targets temporarily.** Define a mode in Overview.md; the dashboard header reflects it and targets shift. Regular targets return when the mode period expires.

**Works with the [Cookbook](./cookbook.md).** When both are active, logging a meal from a tracked recipe auto-populates nutrition data, and meal suggestions consider remaining macro budget. Either works standalone.

**Removing this recipe** is clean: delete `Projects/Diet/`, `Dashboard-Fancy.html`, `diet-today.js`, the two spreadsheets, the guidelines files, the coach's notes log, the weekly analysis archive, and the instruction file hooks. Nothing else references it.

---

## Debugging

**Macro bars show wrong values after a log.** The fancy dashboard reads from `diet-today.js`. If the bars are stale, check that the log event rewrote `diet-today.js` and that the browser reloaded it (hard-reload with Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R to bypass cache).

**Field name mismatch: bars blank or undefined.** If a macro bar in the HTML shows nothing or `NaN`, the JavaScript is reading a field name that doesn't exist in `window.DIET_TODAY`. Compare the field names in `diet-today.js` against the contract table in `Fancy-Dashboard-Build.md`. The contract is exact -- casing and spelling must match.

**Chart missing or broken.** The weight chart and the food log renderer run in separate error isolation blocks. A Chart.js failure will not break the food log, and vice versa. Open the browser console to see which block failed. Common cause: `weightChart` canvas element not found because the HTML was rebuilt incompletely.

**`textContent` destroying child elements.** If a metric card goes blank after an update, the renderer likely called `element.textContent = value` on a container that has child nodes -- this wipes all children. The fix is to target the specific leaf node (e.g., `card-weight-value` not `card-weight`). See the error isolation section of `Fancy-Dashboard-Build.md`.
